## Suggested engine updates

In order to keep the Open Terms Archive engine up-to-date, updates will be automatically suggested by [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/) in a pull request when a new version is available.

While engine updates follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) standard and automated collection tests should provide a safety net, it is ultimately the responsibility of the maintainers of the collection to check version compatibility and potentially adjust the declarations before applying these updates.
